About systemID
==============


Overview
########

**systemID** is an open source collection of Python subroutines for linear and nonlinear system identification.
**systemID** combines mature and well established system identification algorithms with young, newly developed techniques to provide a user friendly API for solving system identification problems.

History
#######

This work started during my PhD at Penn State while I was investigating how to combine existing system identification techniques with more advanced and newly develped methods.
I started implementing the basic algorithms for class projects and as the number of algorithms was growing I decided to

The philosophy behind developing the **systemID** API was to rely on the least amount of external libraries possible.
