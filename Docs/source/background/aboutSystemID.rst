About systemID
==============


Overview
########

**systemID** is an open source collection of Python subroutines for linear and nonlinear system identification.
**systemID** combines mature and well established system identification algorithms with young, newly developed techniques to provide a user friendly API for solving system identification problems.


History
#######

This work started during my PhD at Penn State while I was investigating how to combine existing system identification techniques with more advanced and newly develped methods.
I started implementing the basic algorithms for class projects and as the number of algorithms was growing I decided to


Future Ideas
############

**systemID** has been historically focused on time-domain system identification, and we would like to improve robustness and velocity of execution
In general, we would like to stabilize the API and release a 1.0 version at some point!
