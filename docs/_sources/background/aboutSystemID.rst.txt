About systemID
==============


Overview
########

**systemID** is an open source collection of Python subroutines for linear and nonlinear system identification.
**systemID** combines mature and well established system identification algorithms with young, newly developed
techniques to provide a user friendly API for solving system identification problems.


History
#######

This work started during my PhD at Penn State while I was investigating how to combine existing system identification
techniques with more advanced and newly develped methods. I started implementing the basic algorithms for class
projects and as the number of algorithms was growing I decided to build a Python package that would contain everything
I need to move forward with data-driven modeling in general.


Future Ideas
############

**systemID** has been historically focused on time-domain system identification, and we would like to improve robustness and velocity of execution.
In general, we would like to stabilize the API and release a 1.0 version at some point!
**systemID** represents the first stepping stone of a larger project to build a computationally fast, robust and accurate
data‐driven framework that combines the latest techniques in time‐varying subspace realization methods, sparse
representation and embeddings. Eventually, I would like this framework to be operated real‐time, with real‐time data
collection, process, visualization, and all achieved on‐board (applications for autonomous aerospace vehicles,
space missions). I want to extend the system identification module with an estimation and uncertainty quantification
module, a real‐time learning module, and a data‐driven control and parameters update module.
