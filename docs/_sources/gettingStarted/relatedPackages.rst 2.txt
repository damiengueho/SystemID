Requirements & Related Packages
===============================

**systemID** is usually tested on macOS X on Python 3.7 and 3.8. It should work on Linux and Windows without problems.

Although the philosophy behind the development of the **systemID** API is to rely on the least amount of external libraries possible,
**systemID** requires a number of Python packages, notably:
    * `numpy <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>`_, for basic numerical routines;
    * `scipy <https://pypi.org/project/scipy/>`_, for advanced linear algebra and numerical integration;
    * `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>`_, for plotting.
